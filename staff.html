<p>
  Our guest authors are established and new, old and young, male and female, and
  any number of additional combinations and contradictions. What they all have
  in common, however, is a good literary experience to share. This list includes
  every guest author we've had so far, and each name links to more details.

    <p>{{ author.excerpt }}</p>

  {% endfor %}
