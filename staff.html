<h1 class="staff">Guest Authors</h1>
<p>
  Our guest authors are established and new, old and young, male and female, and
  any number of additional combinations and contradictions. What they all have
  in common, however, is a good story or poem to share. This list includes every
  guest author we've had so far.

<ul>
  {% for author in site.authors %}
  <li class="blog">
    <h2><a href="{{ author.url }}">{{ author.name }}</a></h2>
    <p>{{ author.content | markdownify }}</p>
  </li>
  {% endfor %}
</ul>
