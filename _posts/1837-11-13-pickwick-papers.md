<strong>THE PICKWICKIANS</strong>
<p></p>

The first ray of light which illumines the gloom, and converts into a dazzling
brilliancy that obscurity in which the earlier history of the public career<!--more--> of
the immortal Pickwick would appear to be involved, is derived from the perusal
of the following entry in the Transactions of the Pickwick Club, which the
editor of these papers feels the highest pleasure in laying before his readers,
as a proof of the careful attention, indefatigable assiduity, and nice
discrimination, with which his search among the multifarious documents confided
to him has been conducted.

‘May 12, 1827. Joseph Smiggers, Esq., P.V.P.M.P.C. [Perpetual
Vice-President—Member Pickwick Club], presiding. The following resolutions
unanimously agreed to:—

‘That this Association has heard read, with feelings of unmingled satisfaction,
and unqualified approval, the paper communicated by Samuel Pickwick, Esq.,
G.C.M.P.C. [General Chairman—Member Pickwick Club], entitled “Speculations on
the Source of the Hampstead Ponds, with some Observations on the Theory of
Tittlebats;” and that this Association does hereby return its warmest thanks to
the said Samuel Pickwick, Esq., G.C.M.P.C., for the same.

‘That while this Association is deeply sensible of the advantages which must
accrue to the cause of science, from the production to which they have just
adverted—no less than from the unwearied researches of Samuel Pickwick, Esq.,
G.C.M.P.C., in Hornsey, Highgate, Brixton, and Camberwell—they cannot but
entertain a lively sense of the inestimable benefits which must inevitably
result from carrying the speculations of that learned man into a wider field,
from extending his travels, and, consequently, enlarging his sphere of
observation, to the advancement of knowledge, and the diffusion of learning.

‘That, with the view just mentioned, this Association has taken into its serious
consideration a proposal, emanating from the aforesaid, Samuel Pickwick, Esq.,
G.C.M.P.C., and three other Pickwickians hereinafter named, for forming a new
branch of United Pickwickians, under the title of The Corresponding Society of
the Pickwick Club.

‘That the said proposal has received the sanction and approval of this
Association.

‘That the Corresponding Society of the Pickwick Club is therefore hereby
constituted; and that Samuel Pickwick, Esq., G.C.M.P.C., Tracy Tupman, Esq.,
M.P.C., Augustus Snodgrass, Esq., M.P.C., and Nathaniel Winkle, Esq., M.P.C.,
are hereby nominated and appointed members of the same; and that they be
requested to forward, from time to time, authenticated accounts of their
journeys and investigations, of their observations of character and manners, and
of the whole of their adventures, together with all tales and papers to which
local scenery or associations may give rise, to the Pickwick Club, stationed in
London.

‘That this Association cordially recognises the principle of every member of the
Corresponding Society defraying his own travelling expenses; and that it sees no
objection whatever to the members of the said society pursuing their inquiries
for any length of time they please, upon the same terms.

‘That the members of the aforesaid Corresponding Society be, and are hereby
informed, that their proposal to pay the postage of their letters, and the
carriage of their parcels, has been deliberated upon by this Association: that
this Association considers such proposal worthy of the great minds from which it
emanated, and that it hereby signifies its perfect acquiescence therein.’
