*3 May. Bistritz.* &mdash; Left Munich at 8:35 P.M, on 1st May, arriving at
Vienna early next morning; should have arrived at 6:46, but train was an hour
late. Buda-Pesth seems a wonderful place,<!--more--> from the glimpse which I got of it
from the train and the little I could walk through the streets. I feared to go
very far from the station, as we had arrived late and would start as near the
correct time as possible.

We left in pretty good time, and came after nightfall to Klausenburgh. Here I
stopped for the night at the Hotel Royale. I had for dinner, or rather supper, a
chicken done up some way with red pepper, which was very good but thirsty.
(*Mem*., get recipe for Mina.) I asked the waiter, and he said it was called
“paprika hendl,” and that, as it was a national dish, I should be able to get
it anywhere along the Carpathians. I found my smattering of German very useful
here; indeed, I don’t know how I should be able to get on without it.
