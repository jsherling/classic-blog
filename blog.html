<h1>Latest Posts</h1>

<p>
  These are the most recent posts that have crossed our front desk. We try to
  add posts every week, but some weeks are busy, hectic even, and others are
  more sedate. Entries tend to arrive more often during the mid spring to late
  fall months, so just keep checking back. It's worth the wait.
</p>

<ul>
  {% for post in site.posts %}
  <li class="blog">
    <h2 class="post-title">
      <a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a>
    </h2>
    <small>{{ post.author }} | {{ post.date | date: "%b %d, %Y" }}</small>
    <p>
      {{ post.excerpt }}
    </p>
  </li>
  {% endfor %}
</ul>
