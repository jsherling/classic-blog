<h1>Latest Posts</h1>

<p>
  These are the most recent posts that have crossed our desks. We try to add a
  post about every week, but some weeks are busy, hectic even, and others are
  more sedate. Entries arrive more often during the mid spring to late fall
  months, so just keep checking back. It's worth the wait.
</p>

<ul>
  {% for post in site.posts %}
  <li class="blog">
    <h2 class="post-title">
      <a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a>
    </h2>
    <small>{{ post.author }} | {{ post.date | date: "%b %d, %Y" }}</small>
    <p>
      {{ post.excerpt }}
    </p>
  </li>
  {% endfor %}
</ul>
