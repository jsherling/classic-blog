We are thrilled to be able to offer excerpts from the latest efforts of authors
all over the world &mdash; and time. We count ourselves lucky to be able to
present such a spectacular range of insight, wit, wisdom, and foresight.  

Every one of these offerings hold great promise, bordering on or exceeding the
minimal expectation of greatness. Who can forget the opening to newcomer Herman
Melville's Moby Dick? Or the tension present in the first paragraphs of Bram
Stoker's Dracula?

Each excerpt post is presented from a forthcoming work, be it novel, poem,
screenplay, or essay. Some works have been years or even decades in the making,
so we feel honored in being able to present them for you on this blog.  

Kick back and enjoy!  

Yours,  

The Timeless Classics, Inc. staff
