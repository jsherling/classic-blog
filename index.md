title: Guest Authors & A Classic Blog
---

We are thrilled to be able to offer excerpts from the latest efforts of authors
hailing from all over the world &mdash; and time. We count ourselves lucky to be
able to host such a spectacular range of insight, wit, wisdom, and foresight.  

Every one of these offerings hold great promise, bordering on or exceeding the
minimal expectations of greatness. Who can forget the opening to Herman
Melville's Moby Dick? Or the tension present in the first paragraphs of Bram
Stoker's Dracula?

Each excerpt post is presented from a forthcoming work, be it novel, poem,
screenplay, or essay. Some works have been years or even decades in the making,
so we feel honored in being able to present them for you on this blog.  

To make room for these excerpts, and because they're so sublime in their
perfection, we have dumped a good amount of our pages that, frankly, weren't up
to snuff. You can blame the bickering staff: it's our nature. About the quality
writing: kick back and enjoy!

Yours,  

The Timeless Classics staff
